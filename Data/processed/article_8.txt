Goulamirian-Ramirez style clash will deliver says Abel Sanchez and Malik Scott

Gilberto Ramirez is the top-ranked cruiserweight despite only having one fight
in the division. He will face Arsen Goulamirian for the WBA cruiserweight title.
Goulamirian is also undefeated but has been inactive. Ramirez's trainer believes
his discipline and mobility will give him an advantage, while Goulamirian's
coach emphasizes his aggressive style and presence. The undercard features
Alexis Rocha, Ricardo Sandoval, and other promising prospects. Golden Boy
Promotions has announced a partnership with Hollywood Park venues, including the
potential for future fights at SoFi Stadium.
