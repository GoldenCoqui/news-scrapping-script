leading to Garcia's upset victory. This psychological warfare, coupled with
Garcia's unwavering self-belief, paid off handsomely, earning him a career-
defining performance and a possible path to superstardom.</p></body></html><html><head><title>My News Aggregation Site</title></head><body><h1>Ryan Garcia trolls Devin Haney to shock majority decision win in Brooklyn</h1><p>Ryan Garcia defeated Devin Haney in a majority decision, despite Garcia missing
