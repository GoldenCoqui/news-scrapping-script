Oscar Valdez: That Loss To Navarrete Was The Lowest Iâ€™ve Been In The Aftermath

Former champion Oscar Valdez struggled to cope with his loss to Emanuel
Navarrete in August. Despite being injured, Valdez regained motivation through
discipline and is returning to the scene of his defeat for a title fight against
Liam Wilson. Valdez views this as a career-defining fight and feels mentally and
physically prepared after a difficult training camp. A win could set up a
rematch with Navarrete, while a loss would leave his future uncertain.
