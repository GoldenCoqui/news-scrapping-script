Oscar Valdez: That Loss To Navarrete Was The Lowest Iâ€™ve Been In The Aftermath

Oscar Valdez faced a tough loss to Emanuel Navarrete in August 2023, leaving him
mentally shaken. However, discipline drove him back to training. He returns to
the scene of his defeat for a fight against Liam Wilson, challenging for the
interim WBO 130-pound title. Valdez views it as a defining fight in his career
after two previous losses. Despite a slow recovery from injury, he now feels
refreshed and ready for the challenge.
