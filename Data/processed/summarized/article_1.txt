Method and madness: Ryan Garcia and his unlikely rise to the throne

Like Hamlet in Shakespeare's play, rising star Ryan Garcia exhibited
unconventional behavior before his fight with Devin Haney. Garcia's antics,
including public intoxication and excessive spending, appeared chaotic but were
part of a strategic psychological warfare campaign. Garcia's performance, which
included a stunning weight gain, was designed to shake Haney's confidence.
Despite Garcia's lack of polish compared to the veteran Haney, his tactics
proved effective, resulting in an upset victory. Garcia's actions have raised
questions about his mental state and potential future challenges in matchmaking,
but his success highlights the power of psychological warfare in boxing.
