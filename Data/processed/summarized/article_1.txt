Method and madness: Ryan Garcia and his unlikely rise to the throne

Ryan Garcia's pre-fight antics, considered by many as madness, were a strategic
move to undermine his opponent, Devin Haney, and boost his own confidence. His
unconventional behavior, including drinking beer during weigh-ins and wearing a
million-dollar crown, distracted Haney from Garcia's formidable left hook,
leading to Garcia's upset victory. This psychological warfare, coupled with
Garcia's unwavering self-belief, paid off handsomely, earning him a career-
defining performance and a possible path to superstardom.
