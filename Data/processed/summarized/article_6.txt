Sebastian Fundora may have a few surprises for Tim Tszyu

Sebastian Fundora and Tim Tszyu will fight for two major titles on Saturday in
Las Vegas. Fundora had previously lost to Brian Mendoza due to a brief lapse in
concentration. Despite his setback, Fundora's trainer has stated that he is now
more determined than ever. Fundora, a 6'5" southpaw with an 80-inch reach, will
have a significant height advantage over Tszyu. While Tszyu has verbally engaged
with Errol Spence Jr. and Terence Crawford, Fundora remains focused on the fight
at hand. Both fighters appear confident heading into the bout.
