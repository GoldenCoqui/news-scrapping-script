Jose Salas scores unanimous decision win over Luis Guzman in Tijuana

Jose Salas extended his undefeated record to 15-0 with a unanimous decision
victory over Luis Guzman. Despite Guzman's moments in the middle rounds, Salas'
speed and accuracy proved decisive. Salas also showcased his knockout power in a
fourth-round stoppage of Aston Palicte earlier in 2023. In the co-main event,
Abel Ramos overpowered Juan Ramon Guzman, stopping him in the fifth round. Other
undercard highlights included Alejandra Guzman's unanimous decision win,
Alejandro Aguilera's dominating performance, and Kevin Piedrahita's third-round
stoppage.
