Goulamirian-Ramirez style clash will deliver says Abel Sanchez and Malik Scott

Gilberto Ramirez, despite having only fought once as a cruiserweight, holds the
No. 1 spot in Boxrec's rankings due to his impressive 45-1 record. He is set to
face Arsen Goulamirian, the WBA beltholder, in a title fight. Ramirez's trainer
believes his boxing style will be effective against Goulamirian, while
Goulamirian's trainer expects his come-forward style to prevail. The co-main
event features Alexis Rocha returning to action after a knockout loss, while
Ricardo Sandoval and rising star Joel Iriarte will also fight on the card.
