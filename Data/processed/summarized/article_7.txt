Devin Haney Will Retain WBC Title, Expected To Next Make Mandatory Defense

Devin Haney retained his WBC 140-pound title despite losing to Ryan Garcia in a
non-title bout. Garcia exceeded the weight limit, disqualifying him from
challenging for the title. Haney's compliance with the weight requirement
preserved his championship status according to WBC rules. Garcia's victory marks
his career highlight but leaves him without a major title, while Haney remains
the reigning WBC champion.
