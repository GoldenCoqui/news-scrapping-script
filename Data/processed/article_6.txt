Sebastian Fundora may have a few surprises for Tim Tszyu

Sebastian Fundora, who lost a previous fight due to a lapse in concentration,
now has the chance to win two major titles against Tim Tszyu. Fundora is
confident despite Tszyu's concerns about his dietary choices. Fundora credits
his mental strength and boxing skills, honed since childhood, for his success.
He dismisses the possibility of complacency and remains focused on the task at
hand, while Tszyu faces the challenge of not overlooking Fundora for potential
future fights.
