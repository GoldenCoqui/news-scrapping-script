It wasn’t a feeling Oscar Valdez expected to linger once August transitioned
into September. More than a month had passed, and he still couldn’t shake off
his loss to countryman Emanuel Navarrete. Their August 12 ESPN headliner was
entertaining to the crowd of 10,246 at Desert Diamond Arena in Glendale,
Arizona. The all-Mexico battle ended with Navarrete’s arm raised in victory via
unanimous decision as he retained the WBO 130-pound title. Valdez (31-2, 23
knockouts), No. 7 at 130, was left with a broken orbital bone around his right
eye to go with the defeat. Time eventually healed the physical wounds. It
required more time than expected, however, to mentally push past that summer
night. “That loss to ‘El Vaquero’ Navarrete was one of the saddest things, the
lowest I’ve been in the aftermath,” Valdez told The Ring. “To go home and see my
family feel bad for me, that was even worse. I can say, it was a hard couple of
weeks after that. Even when I went back to the gym, I’m running the treadmill. I
look up at the TV and go figure. It’s my fight with Vaquero Navarrete. “I knew
God was testing me. I had zero motivation to go back to the gym. But that’s
where motivation doesn’t apply. Discipline applies. I didn’t care that I didn’t
have the motivation because discipline always gets you through in the gym.”
Fittingly, Valdez returns to the scene of the crime for his next outing. A
productive training camp precedes his scheduled twelve-round bout versus
Australia’s Liam Wilson (13-2, 7 KOs). The two-time Olympian for Mexico and
former two-division titlist will even challenge for a secondary version of the
same belt. The interim WBO 130-pound title is at stake for Friday’s ESPN+ main
event from Desert Diamond Arena. The best-case scenario puts the winner in a
lucrative rematch with Navarrete (38-1-1, 31 KOs), No. 1 at 130. The alternative
is a default upgrade to full titlist should Navarrete remain at 135, where he
challenges for a fourth-divisional title in May. It’s a second chance that
Valdez cherishes, given the generally unforgiving nature of boxing. “Boxing is a
cruel sport. When you lose, it’s almost like you’re out of the game and it’s on
to the next one,” noted Valdez. “For me to be able to return to what is
basically my home state and against a great fighter in Liam Wilson, it means the
world to me. This is a career-defining fight for me. “I train hard for every
fight. But there was something different in training for this fight.” There came
greater purpose in preparation for his showdown with Wilson, who also lost to
Navarrete in this very venue. Valdez was still recovering from a prior injury
and reduced to spectator as Wilson nearly shocked the world last February. The
visiting Aussie dropped Navarrete for the first time in his career in round
four. Navarrete eventually rallied back, as he dropped and stopped Wilson in the
ninth round of their vacant WBO 130-pound title fight. Two wins have followed
for Wilson, both in Australia as he returns stateside and to the top contender
level. Valdez has not fought since his loss to Navarrete. His lone win in a span
of more than two years was his unanimous decision over Adam Lopez last May 20.
It came thirteen months after he was outpointed by Shakur Stevenson in their
April 2020 RING and unified WBC/WBO 130-pound championship. Needless to say,
Friday represents a must-win situation for Valdez. He’d already come to that
realization by the time he was back in the presence of head trainer Eddy
Reynoso. It took longer than expected, but it’s about the journey far more than
the destination. The proper perspective was eventually obtained to move beyond
what he considered the low point of his career. “About a month-and-a-half, two
months after the fight, I was okay,” noted Valdez. “It was still in the back of
my mind. But out of nowhere, just training with Eddy, everything just clicked.
It was a new mindset. That’s how it is in life, not just inside that ring. It
was nothing but positive thinking. “I feel fresh now. Mentally and physically,
I’m all clear. I’m ready and more importantly, I’m enjoying it. I enjoyed every
piece of this camp. You better believe I’ve gone all in for this fight.” Jake
