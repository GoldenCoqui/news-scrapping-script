NEW YORK — In a career marked by high contact fights, Sergiy Derevyanchenko had
a rare night where his skills were able to keep him out of trouble. The 38-year-
old Ukrainian contender lived up to his “Technician” nickname on Saturday night,
outboxing journeyman Vaughn Alexander to a routine unanimous decision win on the
Devin Haney vs. Ryan Garcia undercard at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. All
three judges scored the fight 100-89 for Derevyanchenko (15-5, 10 knockouts),
who is based in Brooklyn and originally hails from Feodosia, Ukraine. The win in
the ten-round super middleweight bout was just the second in the last six fights
for Derevyanchenko, a three-time title challenger who has arguably faced the
toughest schedule of opposition in the middleweight divisions over the five
years. After a slow start, Derevyanchenko began turning up the heat in round
three, firing combinations of short punches and then sliding out to his left and
right to fire quick counterpunches on the plodding Alexander. Alexander landed
his best punch of the fight in round five, an uppercut, but was promptly
punished by the quicker-footed Derevyanchenko, whose ability to create angles
earned him several right hand counters. This pattern persisted over the course
of the fight as Alexander walked forward without a jab, allowing Derevyanchenko
to beat him to the punch consistently before circling out to safety.
Derevyanchenko scored the fight’s only knockdown in round 8 with a left hook to
the body which Alexander never saw coming. Alexander looked to be finished, but
was given a few extra seconds to recover as referee Steve Willis comically
ordered Derevyanchenko back to the neutral corner, with the bell sounding to end
the bout once Willis resumed the action. Derevyanchenko piled on the offense in
the ninth round before seeming to settle in for the distance in the tenth. The

years old, loses for the fourth straight time. Photo by Cris Esqueda/Golden Boy
Darius Fulghum barely needed to get out of first gear in his first fight on the
east coast, scoring a fourth round stoppage of Cristian Olivas at the 50-second
mark of an eight-round schedule super middleweight bout. Fulghum (11-0, 10 KOs)
of Houston, Tex. controlled the bout with his superior technique before the
fight was brought to an end due to a mercy stoppage. The 27-year-old Fulghum,
who won the 2018 National Golden Gloves and 2020 U.S. Olympic Team Trials,
signed with Golden Boy Promotions last October. Olivas (22-11, 19 KOs) of
Mexicali, Mexico loses by stoppage for just the second time, and falls to 0-7 in
the United States. Lightweight prospect Jonathan Canas (4-0, 2 KOs) of Santa
Ana, Calif. shut out Markus Bowes (2-6, 2 KOs) over four rounds, winning by
scores of 40-36 across the board. Junior middleweight prospect Amari Jones
(12-0, 11 KOs) scored his fourth straight stoppage win, finishing Germany-based
fighter Armel Mbumba-Yassa (10-2-1, 7 KOs) a 39 seconds of round 6. The 21-year-
old Jones, a 2019 USA Youth National champion, is originally from Oakland,
Calif. Kevin Newman II (16-3-1, 9 Kos) of Los Angeles scored a fourth round
stoppage of Eric Robles (9-4) at the 1:53 mark of an eight round super

Shamar Canal (8-0, 4 KOs) of Schenectady, N.Y. scored a six-round unanimous
decision win over Pedro Borgaro (7-2, 4 KOs), scoring a knockdown in round three
to win by scores of 60-53 across the board. Ryan Songalia has written for ESPN,
