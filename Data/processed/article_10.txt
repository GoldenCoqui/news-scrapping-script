Yokasta Valle vows to be the kryptonite to Seniesa Estradaâ€™s caped hero act

Yokasta Valle has been a professional prizefighter for ten years, and her career
has progressed from aspiring fighter to pound-for-pound contender. This Friday,
she will defend her IBF and WBO strawweight belts against undefeated Seniesa
Estrada. Valle has been preparing hard for this fight, and her trainer Gloria
Alvarado believes she will be even better than before. Valle is motivated to
win, especially since Estrada has been speaking negatively about her. Despite
Estrada's status as the current pound-for-pound champion, Valle is confident she
will emerge victorious.
