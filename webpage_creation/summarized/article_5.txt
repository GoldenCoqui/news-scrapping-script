Malik Zinad hits the road once again to face Jerome Pampellone in Sydney on Wed.

Libyan boxer Malik Zinad left home due to political unrest, turned pro in Malta,
and has won 21 fights. Despite being the first professional boxer from Libya, he
has faced challenges finding big fights. Zinad now faces Jerome Pampellone in
Australia for an IBF title eliminator, determined to make a name for himself.
